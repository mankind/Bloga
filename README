This is Rails 3.0.1 blog app showing how to receiving incoming email in Rails.

It use devise for authentication and dynamic form plugin.

In bloga/script, you will find the mail_receiver script that is fetch new mails from gmail

Download it to your local machine and:

Add gmail username and passowrd to bloga/config/initializers/set_mail.rb for receiving email
Also add bloga/config/mail.yml  for sending email

You can run commands like
 ruby script/mail_receiver_ctl.rb start  to start your script 
 and
